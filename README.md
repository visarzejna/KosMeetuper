# Meetups `description`

- Meetups is a VueJs, Vuex and NodeJs, Express application developed to improve my skills in FullStack developing. *(has asp.net but I changed all the requests to use NodeJs)*
- You can watch information about events, based on your IP Address you can find events close to you, you need to create an account and create your own meetups.
- You can edit your profile delete meetups threads or posts. 
- Posts update in real-time so you can have a flowing conversation with people who are also going to this event.
- Admin can maintain the users, meetups, feedback coming from Contact page, FAQ and categories.
